# 🪐 iTPMR – Integrated Tri-Phase Modular Recycler
### NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 Project  
**Team:** Astralynx  
**Challenge:** SpaceTrash Hack: Revolutionizing Recycling on Mars



## 🚀 Project Overview
The **Integrated Tri-Phase Modular Recycler (iTPMR)** is a compact, all-in-one recycling system designed for long-duration **Martian missions**.  
It processes **plastic**, **metal**, and **foam/fabric** waste into reusable resources such as:
- 3D printing filament  
- Metal ingots for repairs  
- Composite blocks for construction  

This project aims to demonstrate **a closed-loop recycling ecosystem**, reducing reliance on Earth resupply missions and ensuring a sustainable human presence on Mars.



## 🧠 Simulation Description
The **iTPMR Web Simulator** models how the system operates over time using real engineering and energy data assumptions.  
It calculates:
- Waste processing rates  
- Recycling efficiency improvements  
- Power consumption per module  
- Gas filtration and emission control  
- Material recovery outputs  



## 🌍 Features
- 📊 Real-time data visualization (Streamlit Web App)  
- 🔋 Power and efficiency modeling for all modules  
- 🧱 Material yield prediction (filament, ingots, blocks)  
- 🌫️ Gas filtration simulation for astronaut safety  
- ♻️ Dynamic user input (waste type & mission duration)
